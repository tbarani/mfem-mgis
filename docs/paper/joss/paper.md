# Summary

The MFEM-MGIS-MFRONT application (abbreviated version MMM), aims at
efficiently use supercomputers in the field of implicit nonlinear
thermomechanics. This open-source library is based on several components as
prerequisites. The first component, `MFEM` [1,6], is a finite element library
designed for current supercomputers but also for the upcoming exascale
supercomputers. It provides many useful features for carrying out realistic
simulations: support for curvilinear meshes, high order approximation spaces
and different families of finite elements, interfaces to several types of
parallel solvers (including matrix-free ones), preconditioners, and native
support for adaptive non-conforming mesh refinement (AMR).  

## MFEM-based Thermo-Mechanical Solver for Nuclear Fuel Simulations

Originating from the applied mathematics and parallel computing communities, `MFEM` offers both
performance and a large panel of advanced mathematical features. In particular,
one can easily switch from one linear solver to another (direct or iterative),
which is essential for the targeted application: microstructure and mesoscale
modelling for nuclear fuel. However, applications to solid mechanics in `MFEM`
are mostly limited to simple constitutive equations such as elasticity and
hyperelasticity, which is insufficient. 

## Objectives

The aim of the `MMM` project is to
combine `MFEM` with the `MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport` (`MGIS`) project [@Helfer2020], an
open-source `C++` library that provides convenient data structures to support
arbitrarily complex nonlinear constitutive equations generated by the
open-source `MFront` code generator [2,5]. This library handles all the kinds of
behaviour supported by `MFront`. In the field of nonlinear mechanics, this
encompasses arbitrary complex behaviours that can describe damage, plasticity,
viscoplasticity, phase change in small and finite strain analyses. Generalised
behaviours such as strongly coupled thermomechanical behaviours, variational
approaches to fracture, Cosserat media are supported by `MGIS` and will be
considered in future versions of `MMM`. Thanks to the coupling with `MGIS` and
MFront and specific developments made, `MMM` has added the following mechanical
features compared to pure `MFEM` approach described in section Mechanics features.

The implementation of high order meshes or finite elements is easy.
The library tackles some peculiarities of nonlinear mechanics. In particular,
the support of complex constitutive laws and the management of advanced
boundary conditions.  The `MMM` library [7] is written in `C++-17` language and
provides a very high level of abstraction based on a very declarative
text-based Application Programming Interface. 

## Integrate MMM in an Open Source Ecosystem

The `MMM` library takes full advantage of an open-source software (OSS) stack. It
benefits from the increasing maturity of many communities and tools working
together. Thus, within `MFEM`, one has many available choices to set the linear
solver, such as: `Hypre`, `PETSc`, `MUMPS`, `SuperLU`, `UMFPACK` or other ones. Likewise,
several preconditioners, partitioning libraries, or input mesh formats can be
activated and used. Combinations are highly configurable and almost all
external libraries are switchable. To handle the numerous accessible
combinations, Spack is really a cornerstone. This package manager simplifies
building, installing, customizing, and sharing HPC software stacks. It provides
a simple way for installing packages with cumbersome structures and lots of
dependencies. `Spack` is an open-source package manager developed and maintained
by community of HPC developers. Our setup that combines OSS allows for a fast
and cheap access to advanced features embedded in the underlying libraries.

# Numerical Results

Installation and deployment on desktop or large computers is based on the Spack
package manager [10]. With MMM, we were able to carry out a multi-material
elastic modelling on computing clusters. Scalability performance is good on a
few thousands of CPU cores. Despite the very high level of abstraction and the
genericness of MMM (multi-material and arbitrary behaviours), the overhead
appears reasonably limited, roughly 30% compared to a pure MFEM version which
provides very optimised and specialised kernels (this was tested on an elastic
setting with 2 materials). Several examples can be found on the open-source GitHub 
repository: `https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples`. Below is a non-exhaustive 
list of examples running on supercomputers.

## Tensile test on a elastoplastic notched bar with large strain - SSNA303

  A notched specimen under axisymmetric hypotheses so-called [SSNA303](https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples/tree/master/ex4) is given in ([ex4](https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples/tree/master/ex4)) of [MMM-examples](https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples) a collection of use cases for MMM library. The behavior is a simple isotropic plasticity behaviour with von-Mises isotropic linear hardening.

  This case ([SSNA303](https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples/tree/master/ex4)) is adapted from a non-regression test of the `Code_Aster` finite element solver, see @edf_ssna303_2011 for details.


## Viscoplastic behaviour of a polycrystalline microstructure for UO2

  A model simulation of UO2 with polycrystalline microstructure has been proposed in ([ex8](https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples/tree/master/ex8)) from [MMM-examples](https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples). The polycrystalline geometrical model is based on a Voronoi diagram and has been generated using [MEROPE](https://github.com/MarcJos/Merope) library.

  Mechanical behavior is implemented with MFront tools. It is provided by a unique single-crystal plasticity model proposed for UO2, which is modified according to the orthotropy directions of the polycrystal.
  
  The mechanical loading conditions corresponds to a uniaxial compression test with periodic conditions of the microstructure :

    - periodic boundaries conditions in all directions,
    - imposed uniform strain in z-axis direction,
    - null macroscopic stresses in x and y directions.

# Performance Results of Thermo-Mechanical Libraries on HPC plateforms"

Computation related to the behavior law at Gauss points is independent for each other, and while some behavior laws can be computationally expensive, the primary focus of parallel computation time is on solving linear systems at each time step. As a result, the parallel performance of our library is strongly influenced by the performance of MFEM (Finite Element Library) and, by extension, the selection of appropriate solvers and preconditioners.

Performance analysis framework:
- Strong scaling benchmark (`CEA/CCRT`) AMD Milan architecture until 65,000 cores.
- Only `MPI`.
- 80.10^6 degrees of freedoms (DoFs).
- REV 3D with an elasticity behavior law. Source code is available on the mfem-mgis-example github repository.
- Not enough load per sub-domain with 65k cores (less than 2k finite elements)

# Conclusion

This paper presents the `MMM` HPC application designed to address large scale thermo-mechanical simulation and recent supercomputers. Based on an open-source
software stack, it allows for the fine representation of microstructure in full
3D in the field of fuel modelling. On the one hand, `MGIS` and `MFRONT` bring
nonlinear mechanics features such as damage, plasticity, viscoplasticity
capabilities. On the other hand, `MFEM` provides advanced finite elements schemes
and parallel performance (tested on several thousands of cores until now).
Open-source approach was chosen mainly to: promote collaboration, improve
reproducibility, and reduce costs for development and maintenance.
